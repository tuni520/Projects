General Tips: 
If you have data in Excel that you want to use to create a dashboard, there are a couple of things you’ll want to do first to make sure everything goes well.
 
1. Ensure your data is free of error cells, as this will result in errors.
2. Have proper headings setup so that you know what you are referencing in your dashboard. 
3. Setup a named range for your data, ideally a dynamic one. This will make it easier to link everything to your data quickly and easily.

Making sure your data is clean and ready to go is the most important step, but unfortunately the one that is easily overlooked. After all, if you’re data is no good, your outputs won’t be either. Garbage in, garbage out.
